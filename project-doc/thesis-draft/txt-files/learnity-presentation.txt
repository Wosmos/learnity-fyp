Introduction to Project
► In many underdeveloped areas of Pakistan, students struggle to access quality 
education due to high costs and a shortage of qualified teachers. Learnity addresses 
this issue by providing an affordable, localized online learning platform that connects 
students with verified tutors, supports group study, and uses a streak-based 
motivation system.
► Focused on grades 1 to 12, Learnity follows the Pakistani curriculum and offers a 
bilingual (Urdu-English) interface. Built with modern technologies like Next.js, 
Firebase, and MySQL, it aims to make quality education accessible, engaging, and 
affordable for every student.

Project Overview
► Learnity is a web and mobile platform for Pakistani students 
(Grades 1-12).
► Connects students with verified tutors for affordable 
one-on-one sessions.
► Provides study groups for peer-to-peer collaborative 
learning.
► Offers curriculum-aligned resources matching Matric/FSc 
syllabi.
► Supports Urdu + English interface for accessibility.

Project Overview Continued!
► Students can search, book, and rate tutors by subject and 
grade.
► Study groups enable chat, video calls, and resource sharing.
► Gamification system rewards users with points and badges.
► Admin approval ensures only qualified tutors join the platform.
► Learnity bridges education gaps in Pakistan — affordable, 
accessible, localized.

Literature View / Similar projects
► Several e-learning platforms such as Khan Academy, Coursera, and Preply provide 
online tutoring and educational resources. However, these platforms often focus on 
international curricula and are too costly for students in Pakistan.
► Research by Memon et al. (2021) highlights that tools like WhatsApp were used for 
learning during COVID-19, but they lack structure, teacher verification, and progress 
tracking.
Studies on gamification in education (Hamari, 2023) show that reward-based learning 
improves student motivation and consistency.
► Learnity builds upon these findings by offering a localized, affordable, and bilingual 
(Urdu-English) platform that integrates verified tutoring, study groups, and gamified 
progress tracking for Pakistani students.
