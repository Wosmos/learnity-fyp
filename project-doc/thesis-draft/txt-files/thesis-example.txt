ABSTRACT  
Students and teachers have been facing problem due to the absence of centralized web 
service for the department. This project solves their problem in the form of providing 
DYNAMIC INTERFACE OF MEDIA AND COMMMUNICATION which gives 
them ready access to information and centralized system for assignments, timetable, 
notes and results.  
DYNAMIC INTERFACE OF MEDIA AND COMMMUNICATION is design for the 
purpose to ease the communication between Teachers and Students. There are 
different kinds of users that have different roles on this portal. The major users are 
students and Teachers which take the most advantage of this website. Once a teacher 
and student are registered, they will receive benefits from this website. This project 
will also help in collaborative learning. 
On the other hand, administrator of the website is able to centralize the information 
between students and teachers. He/she can access to every part of the website and 
have right to edit, delete, change, upload, making reports and supervise the system. It 
will reduce the burden of collection, organization, management and sharing of notes, 
assignments, and announcement of exam timetable, results and event notifications 
which are being maintained manually by the faculty.

INTRODUCTION 
1.1 BACKGROUND 
Websites are built since the breakthrough of internet. WWW (World Wide Web) 
further helped many institutions to be more connected worldwide this magnitude of 
change and advancement led them develop like never before! Now there was a way to 
which information shared and received between more than on domain, it grew up as 
the joint and giant system of wholly interconnected networks known as web and the 
particular location is said to be the (side) networked with its different entities and a 
main server where the resources that are shared from various locations are to be easily 
shared with others of that similarity.  
University of Sindh is the one of the most reputable universities in the Pakistan and it 
has the honor of second oldest university of Pakistan. With respect to the institute and 
the university in particular the stuff and the students, a (website) was a must thing to 
be included restively within the institute so that, like other well-known institutes of 
university the Institute of Mass Communication can also provide some flexibility to 
the student with the work that is carried on the help of website. 
1.2 DEPARTMENT OF MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION  
This department, founded in 1977 as the Department of Journalism Department of 
Mass Communication in 1985. Keeping the latest market requirement department is 
renamed as “MEDIA & COMMUNICATION STUDIES” in year 2013. It trains 
students for career in the fields of communication and journalism offering BS and 
Masters of Arts (M.A) programme in Media & Communication Studies. The 
four-year BS degree courses have been redesigned to provide professional education 
with theory-cum-research and practical based approach in everyday life-like situation 
and meet the needs of market and professional fields i.e., print media, electronic 
1 
media, journalism, advertising, public relations and development support 
communication.  
Practically, it is the only institution offering courses in Media & Communication 
Studies to the people of rural and urban Sindh. The Department has a well-stocked 
seminar library with a fine collection of more than 3500 latest books and periodicals 
and also has two well-equipped media laboratories, comprising sufficient number of 
computers, well established Studio, video cameras, editing processors, tape recorders, 
multimedia projectors and laser printers etc.  
The students are required to write and report news stories, columns, articles and 
features in weekly newspaper ‘Roshni’ and monthly magazine ‘Shaoor’ reflecting 
scholarly and independent thought. Under these programs students are treated as 
journalists who would one day be called upon to accept responsibilities in 
administrative or supervisory positions in media organizations. 
1.3 OBJECTIVES 
Department of Media & Communication Studies seeks to provide students with 
a leading-edge education that emphasizes a core of fundamental concepts, 
values and skills that make them prepare for an era of unprecedented change. It 
will educate students to understand the whole of mass communication, to solve 
problems, to understand the ethical and legal implications of media and 
communication, to be comfortable with innovation and to work in concert with 
their peers. It will make them confident for leadership roles in their professions 
and their communities. 
● To use media for social development.  
● To give a theoretical & practical understanding about media 
culture.

distribution techniques.  
● To work towards building a better media culture.  
2 
The dynamic interface of Department Of Media & Communication Studies provides 
information in a clear and accessible format, promoting the best user experience 
possible and facilitate the students and teachers of department in different point of 
views. The purpose of developing this project is to manage the whole website through 
admin panel. 
1.4 SCOPE 
The scope of the Dynamic Interface of Media & Communication Studies to give 
advance content management system where students can make and perform different 
activities for Mass Communication department. the Dynamic Interface of Media & 
Communication is a responsive website customized viewing experience for different 
browser platform (laptop, tablet, and smart phones). Through this dynamic web 
interface students and teachers of Mass communication can make their own account 
and know about their course content, time table, notice board information, department 
culture and celebrations and students can also view their result online.

BACKGROUND AND 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.1 THE WEBSITE  
A website, also written as Web site, web site, or simply site, is a set of related web 
pages served from a single web domain. A website is hosted on at least one web 
server, accessible via a network such as the Internet or a private local area 
network through an Internet address known as a Uniform resource locator. All 
publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web. 
A webpage is a document, typically written in plain text interspersed with formatting 
instructions of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML, XHTML). A webpage may 
incorporate elements from other websites with suitable markup anchors. 
Webpages are accessed and transported with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), 
which may optionally employ encryption (HTTP Secure, HTTPS) to provide security 
and privacy for the user of the webpage content. The user's application, often a web 
browser, renders the page content according to its HTML markup instructions onto 
a display terminal. 
2.2 HISTORY OF WEBSITE 
The World Wide Web (WWW) was created in 1990 by the British CERN 
physicist Tim Berners-Lee. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide 
Web would be free to use for anyone. 
Before the introduction of HTML and HTTP, other protocols such as File Transfer 
Protocol and the gopher protocol were used to retrieve individual files from a server. 
These protocols offer a simple directory structure which the user navigates and 
chooses files to download. Documents were most often presented as plain text files 
without formatting, or were encoded in processor formats. [1] 
4 
2.3 DYNAMIC WEBSITE 
A dynamic website is one that changes or customizes itself frequently and 
automatically. Server-side dynamic pages are generated "on the fly" by computer code 
that produces the HTML and CSS. There are a wide range of software systems, such 
as CGI, Java 
Servlets and Java 
Server 
Pages (JSP), Active 
Server 
Pages and ColdFusion (CFML) that are available to generate dynamic web systems 
and dynamic sites. Various web application frameworks and web template systems are 
available for general-use programming languages like PHP, Perl, Python, and Ruby, to 
make it faster and easier to create complex dynamic web sites. 
2.3.1 AVANTAGES OF DYNAMIC WEBSITE 
Much more functional Website 
Much easier to update 
New content brings people back to the site and helps in the search engines 
Can work as a system to allow staff or users to collaborate. [2] 
2.4 INTRODUCTION TO RESPONSIVE WEBSITE 
Responsive web design (or "RWD") is a type of web design that provides a 
customized viewing experience for different browser platforms. A website created 
with RWD will display a different interface depending   on what device is used to 
access the site. For example, a responsive website may appear one way on a laptop, 
another way on a tablet, and still another way on smart phone. 
Today, many people access websites from mobile devices, rather than desktop 
computers or laptops. While most smart phones can display regular websites, the 
5 
content is difficult to read and even harder to navigate. Therefore, many web 
developers now use responsive web design to provide a better web browsing 
experience on small screens. [3] 
2.5 WEB CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
Web content management system (WCMS) is mainly used to control and publish text 
based document like articles, text documents and information. A CMS is normally 
able to provide the following features: 
Our website is able to provide the information that’s a needed by student, stuff and 
others. Its content is managed in a way like standard content management systems. 
To create Admin panel. 
Identify the main users and their roles within the Institute. 
An ability to assign certain roles and rights within the id and password. 
Administrator has the full control system. 
Accounts will be given to faculty members 
2.5.1 IMPORTANCE OF CMS  
Content management system (CMS) used to manage the content of a website. It helps 
in updating the website easily. It is installed by web designers on the servers. So that it 
can be used website owner/admin. A person using CMS need not be technical or web 
savvy nor do he/she require a technical training for managing the content of a website. 
In a CMS, data can be anything like: - document, event, picture, information about the 
faculty etc. through CMS, one can easily add, edit, and delete images and text in 
website.

ANALYSIS & DESIGN 
3.1 REQUIRMENTS  
A requirement is an objective that must be met. Planners cast most requirements in 
functional terms, leaving design and implementation details to the developers. They 
may specify price, performance, and reliability objectives in fine detail, along with 
some aspects of the user interface. Sometimes, they describe their objectives more 
precisely than realistically. There are two types of requirements given below: 
3.1.1 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
A requirement that specifies a function that a system or component must be able to 
perform is called functional requirement. These include inputs, outputs, calculations, 
external interfaces, communications, and special management information needs. 
Functional requirements are also called behavioral requirements because they address 
what the system does. 
In many cases, if the user requirements are written for the requestor and not the 
end-user, the functional requirements are combined with the functional requirements; 
this is common within companies that have a strong Information Technology 
department that is tasked with doing the work. The Dynamic Interface Of Media and 
Communication has the following functional requirement: 
Administrator must be able to add users, design events, recover passwords 
on user request, upload /delete files. 
Admin can upload result/timetable and students and teachers can view 
them. 
Admin can upload the events and other notifications. 
9 
Students can download the lectures, newspaper and magazine and their 
related stuff.  
3.1.2 NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
Non-Functional Requirements in Software Engineering presents a systematic and 
pragmatic approach to `building quality into' software systems. Systems must exhibit 
software quality attributes, such as accuracy, performance, security and modifiability. 
However, such non-functional requirements are difficult to address in many projects, 
even though there are many techniques to meet functional requirements in order to 
provide desired functionality. 
Non-Functional Requirements in Software Engineering is an excellent resource for 
software engineering practitioners, researchers and students. For example, software 
performance requirements, software external interface requirements, software design 
constraints, and software quality attributes. Nonfunctional requirements are difficult 
to test; therefore, they are usually evaluated subjectively. [5]  
The Dynamic Interface Of Media and Communication has the following 
nonfunctional requirement: 
Availability of every documents, updates etc. on home page. 
Detail of Institute various records, event, program etc. 
Admin 
✔ Post 
✔ Designation 
✔ Department/Discipline 
✔ Contact Details

3.3 ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM 
An entity-relationship diagram (ERD) is a graphical representation of an information 
system that shows the relationship between people, objects, places, concepts or events 
within that system. An ERD is a data modeling technique that can help define 
business processes and can be used as the foundation for a relational database. Three 
main components of an ERD are the entities, which are objects or concepts that can 
have data stored about them, the relationship between those entities, and the 
cardinality, which defines that relationship in terms of numbers.

TOOL & 
TECHNOLOGIES 
4.1 OVERVIEW OF TOOLS 
A software development tool is program or application that software developers use to 
create debug, maintain, or otherwise support other programs and applications. The 
term usually refers to relatively simple programs that can be combined together to 
accomplish a task, much as one might use multiple hand to fix a physical object. 
The history of software tools began with first computers in the early 1950s that used 
linkers, loader, and control program. Tools became famous with UNIX in the early 
1970s with tools like grep, awk and make that meant to be combined flexibly with 
pipes. The term “software tools” came the book of the name by brain Kernighan and 
P. J. Plauger. 
Tools were originally simple and light weight. As some tools have been maintained, 
they have been integrated into more powerful integrated Development Environments 
(IDEs). These environments consolidate functionality into one place, sometime 
increasing simplicity and productivity, other times sacrificing flexibility and 
extensibility. The workflow of IDEs is routinely contrasted with alternative 
approaches, such as the use of UNIX shell tools with text editors like Vim and Emacs. 
The distinction between tools applications is murky. For example, developers use 
simple databases (such as a file containing a list of important values) all the time as 
tools. However, a full-blown database is database is usually thought of as an 
application in its own right. 
For many years, computer Assisted Software Engineering (CASE) tools were sought 
after. Successful tools have proven elusive. In one sense, CASE tools emphasized 
design and architecture support, such as for UML. But the most successful of these 
tools are IDEs.[6]

4.2 HTML/CSS 
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted 
in a file intended for display on a World Wide Web browser page. The markup tells 
the Web browser how to display a Web page's words and images for the user. 
HTML defines the structure and layout of a Web document by using a variety of tags 
and attributes. 
HTML language, called tags are words surrounded by brackets. HTML tags are 
written as pairs, there must be a beginning tag and an ending tag in order to make the 
code display correctly. The firs tag designates how the following text will be grouped 
or displayed, and the closing tag (with a backslash) designates the end of this group or 
display.  
The correct structure for an HTML document starts with,  
<HTML><HEAD> (enter here what document is about) 
<BODY>  
All the information you'd like to include in your Web page fits in between these tags. 
</BODY> 
</HTML> 
4.2.1 HTML5 
HTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes 
web pages. It's actually three kinds of code: HTML, which provides the structure; 
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which take care of presentation; and JavaScript, which 
makes things happen. One of the design goals for HTML5 is to support for 
multimedia on mobile devices.  
4.2.2 Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the 
presentation of a document written in a markup language. CSS describes how HTML 
elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of 
work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. External style sheets 
21 
are stored in CSS files.CSS gives more control over the appearance of a Web page to 
the page creator than to the browser designer or the viewer. With CSS, the sources of 
style definition for a given document element are in this order of precedence: 
1. The STYLE attribute on an individual element tag 
2. The STYLE element that defines a specific style sheet containing style 
declarations or a LINK element that links to a separate document containing 
the STYLE element. In a Web page, the STYLE element is placed between the 
TITLE statement and the BODY statement. [7] 
4.3 PHP  
PHP (Personal Home Page/ Hyper Text Pre-Processor) is a programming language 
that is designed for building a variety of web applications that run on the Windows 
operating system and as well as Linux. Php is simple, powerful, type-safe, and 
object-oriented. The many innovations in php enable rapid web application 
development while retaining the expressiveness and elegance of C-style languages. 
Php is server side scripting language for web development but also used as 
a general-purpose programming language use for enhance the web pages. In HTML 
and PHP code can easily be embedded. PHP is compatible with various platforms like 
windows, Mac, OS X etc  
4.3.1 USAGE PHP SCRIPT  
Three main areas where PHP scripts are used: 
● Server-side scripting 
● Command line scripting 
● Writing desktop applications 
4.3.2 ADVANTAGES OF PHP 
● Open source 
● Simple and very easy to learn. 
● Support for both structural programming and Object Oriented Programming. 
22

NNTP, POP2, HTTP, COM (on Windows) 
● Easy deployment and cost effective hosting. [8] 
4.3.3 APACHE SERVER  
Apache is the most widely used web server software. Developed and maintained by 
Apache Software Foundation, Apache is an open source software available for free. It 
runs on 67% of all web servers in the world. It is fast, reliable, and secure. It can be 
highly customized to meet the needs of many different environments by using 
extensions and modules. 
● APACHE VERSION 3.2.1 
The Apache Software Foundation and The Apache HTTP Server Project are pleased 
to announce the release of version 3.2.1 of the Apache HTTP Server(“Apache”). 
This version of Apache is principally a bug and security fix release. [9] 
4.4 JAVA SCRIPT 
JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. It runs on 
your visitor's computer and doesn't require constant downloads from your website. 
JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript contains 
a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of 
language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. 
● Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to 
control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). 
● Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant 
to running JavaScript on a server.    
JavaScript is used in Web site development to do such things as: 
23 
● Automatically change a formatted date on a Web page 
● Cause a linked-to page to appear in a popup window 
● Cause text or a graphic image to change during a mouse rollover [10] 
4.5  JQUERY

of html. JQuery is the most popular library of JavaScript library use in today. JQuery 
is free, open source software, licensed under the MIT License. Query is ised to make 
it user to navigate a document, Select the document object model, create animation, 
handle events and develop the ajax applications. The jQuery library modular approach 
allows the creation of dynamic web pages and web application. [11] 
4.6 BOOTSTRAP 
Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing 
responsive, mobile first projects on the web. Bootstrap is an open-source Javascript

RESULTS AND 
CONCLUSION 
6.1 RESULT  
It can be said that the required goal has been achieved. Goal was to build a website 
that can work fully dynamic and perform all the operations of the institute. Where 
various announcement, Reports, Objectives, Events and Results much soon could be 
carried out respectively. Using different technologies for this purpose, like content 
management system for Department of Media and Communication Studies has been 
designed and implemented. This can work on single machine and as well as on local 
Area Network. Because of this, users have given chance to get information from one 
place instead of going different sites for same types of information. 
6.2 CONCLUSION 
The internet has become a major resource just not in Education but in every field of 
life, thus the website of Department of Media and Communication Studies has gained 
significance not only from the presentation of site in best way but also in the student’s 
point of view. Hence, we have designed the project to provide the user with easy 
navigation, retrieval of data and necessary feedback as must as possible. 
A good website must be accompanied with user-friendly interface. It should 
convenient for the user to view the content of their interest and to be able to fulfill 
their requirements. The website describes in this project provide the number of 
features. Those are designed to make the user more comfortable at their Comfort 
ends. 
The project helps in understanding the creation of an interactive webpage and the 
technologies use to implement it. the building of this project has given us prestigious 
knowledge about how PHP is used to develop a website, how connects to the database 
45 
to across the data, and how the data and Webpages are modified to provide the user 
with particular application interactive. 
6.3 FUTURE RECOMMENDATION  
The web site of Department of Media and Communication Studies can be enhanced In 
the future. However, the time is very short and in little time period we tried our best to 
make the project perfect and used the expertise in each line of code to reach the peak 
of success. There are some limitations for the current system to which solution can be 
provided as future development by Administrator, if would be implementation for the 
respected Department of Media and Communication Studies University of Sindh. 
In future, an android application can be developed for the purpose of accessing 
information everywhere and anytime. As today is the Era of mobile apps. So, 
we can convert it into mobile application with different platforms such as 
Fonegap, Ionic, IOS and etc. It will give more functionality to DYNAMIC 
INTERCAE OF MASS COMMUNICATION. For this purpose, user should 
have android phone. 
Some more features can be added such as attendance system can be connected 
which will generate student’s monthly attendance in percentage. 
Another feature that is result alert via SMS can be added through which user 
can be notified about results on his/her phone by providing his/her details by 
SMS. 
Online chatting with audio and voice can be implemented in future. 
We can also give access to parents of the children where all the parents have 
knowledge of children’s progress of the month or whole semester. They also 
get their children progress on mobile through SMS. 
46 
Video conferencing can be added for the students involved in group projects/ 
assignments. 
Online assignment submission can be connected with this system.
