CHAPTER 2: BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.1 Introduction 
Learnity is a web application e-learning platform especially designed for Pakistani 
students to get education online from the best tutors out there, according to their 
particular board curriculum. Learnity enables students to select tutors of their 
convenience and can interact with teachers through daily tasks assigned by teachers, 
and parents can track their progress reports with the help of our gamification system. 
Tutors can set their own prices, enabling tutors to not only earn but also teach from their 
place. 
2.2 Online Tutoring and Educational Technology 
2.2.1 Evolution of Online Education 
Online education has come a long way in past years, from being a mere content 
delivery platform to an advanced interactive platform. This fast development of 
technology allowed the students and tutors to interact and share information through 
their device.Not only this our online tutoring technology is still progressing, integrating 
video conferencing, resource sharing, interactive whiteboards, and adaptive learning 
systems. 
In modern life,tutoring platforms have become an essential component of the modern 
learner’s life. It is also beneficial for struggling students who lack in studies due to lack 
of focus , in online tutoring they can control the video according to their pace.  
2.2.2 Market Growth and Demand 
The global online tutoring services market has seen significant growth, with a value of 
$7.69 billion in 2022 and a compound annual growth rate of 14.9% from 2023 to 2030. 
This is due to increasing use of smart devices and also the COVID-19 pandemic had 
also increased the consumption of online education. 
2.2.3 Key Features of Effective Online Tutoring Platforms 
Some important elements that makes online tutoring platforms successful are virtual 
whiteboards, gamification system, video conferencing, and other collaborative tools. 
Accessibility elements like, language support, hearing and visual accessibility and 
compatibility with devices ensure that the platforms covers a wide range of users. 
Data security and privacy is taken care of by encryption of communication, safe and 
authorized storage of data, strict privacy policies, and authentication techniques for 
users. Some websites or platforms are also using the combination of AI and machine 
learning to offer personalized learning based on the learning style  of each individual 
student. 
2.3 Peer-to-Peer Learning 
Peer-to-peer learning, also referred to as collective or group besed or shared  learning, 
in which students of same batch assist each other in gaining knowledge and skills. The 
idea of peer learning has been around from old times to improve literacy and healthy 
competition among students. 
Modern studies have widely verified the advantages of peer learning. Research has 
shown that the process of teaching others about recently acquired knowledge helps 
individuals to better memorization of things. 
2.3.1 Benefits of Peer Instruction 
Peer instruction is effective for learning, the answers and confidence levels of students 
before and after peer discussion were analyzed in several classes. The results showed 
that peer discussion of questions increased accuracy in all classes and grades. 
Peer instruction supports learning in several ways. First, it produces new knowledge 
through the process of explanation and perspective sharing. Second, peer instruction 
enhances metacognition by encouraging more thorough checks of the coherence of 
answers. Third, social processes aid students in monitoring and regulating their 
cognition more effectively than self-explanation. Studies have shown that people 
actively participating in peer learning activities are one and a half times more likely to 
successfully finish their studies and pass exams than those who are passive consumers 
of content. 
2.4 Web Technologies for Educational Platforms 
2.4.1 Technologies used in Web Development 
Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS. 
Backend: Node.js, Nest.js(Typescript). 
Database: Neon Database(PostgreSQL), MongoDB Atlas, Firebase. 
Design Tool: Figma + Stitch. 
Version Control: GitHub, GitHub Actions(CI/CD). 
Deployment: Vercel (frontend), AWS (backend). 
Other tools: VS Code, Postman, JWT, Bcrypt. 
2.4.2 Creating Dynamic and Interactive Websites 
Dynamic websites are different from static websites in terms of their interactivity, 
dynamic content and content consumption by users . Node.js allows programmers to 
create server-side application that can handle user input, data manipulation, and 
requests from user. Dynamic websites are perfect fit for educational website that 
requires personalized user experience, safe & authorize login, and content 
recommendations according to data provided by user. 
Modern web development emphasizes on responsive design to ensure users best 
experience on any device. Responsive web design techniques uses flexible design, 
media queries, and adaptive images to design user interfaces that are smooth on 
computers, tablets, and smartphones. Responsive design are useful for an educational 
website because users may access the website using different devices depending on 
their convenience. 
2.4.3 Security Considerations 
Security is a major concern in web application development, especially in educational 
websites that deal with private user data and process financial transactions. Security 
best practices include the use of strong authentication systems, the verification and 
validation of all user input to avoid SQL injection attacks, strong access control to user, 
and the encryption of sensitive data. 
2.5 Intelligent Tutoring Systems and Adaptive Learning 
2.5.1 Artificial Intelligence in Education 
Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are computer programs that encourage human tutors 
by providing personalized learning and feedback to students. ITS have been shown to 
increase students' performance by some ratio compared to conventional learning 
approaches. ITS use artificial intelligence technologies like machine learning to provide 
students with interactive and personalized learning experiences. 
AI-based ITS differ from conventional tutoring approaches is that they provide cdynamic 
learning curriculam that adjust to students' performance, real-time feedback systems, 
gamification system to track reports and interactive learning. 
2.5.2 Personalization and Adaptive Learning 
Personalization in educational technology is the process of adapting learning to the 
individual requirements, individual preferences, and individual `s learning style. Adaptive 
learning systems use data from student performance or record and provides 
personalized learning materials, and guide students the areas where they require extra 
effort or learning. 
2.6 Challenges and Considerations 
2.6.1 Digital Divide and Accessibility 
Although there are great numberof benefits of online tutoring platforms but the digital 
divide is still a major hurdle. Students belonging to lower-income classes or living in 
rural areas may not have regular access to high speed internet connectivity, computers, 
phones or quiet study space or environment that are suitable for online tutoring. These 
reason can cause  increase of gap in education instead of reducing it. 
To overcome these issues, Plans or techniques such as optimizing platforms for 
low-bandwidth connectivity, consumption of UI friendly design for students using 
smartphones, allowing offline access to notes or materials , and collaborating with local 
organizations to provide access points in rural areas. Otherwise, online tutoring may 
lead to educational inequality. 
2.6.2 Maintaining Engagement and Social Connection 
Online learning platforms can also be unpleasant even when video conferencing and 
messaging options are available, especially for younger learners who can greatly 
benefit from direct human interaction. Conventional teaching approaches can also 
encourage better student-teacher relationships than online interactions. Problems 
include the sense of recognizing that student is getting  bored or zoning out between the 
lecture, limiting our regular conventional learning can cause health risks associated with 
prolonged screen time and procrastination. 
Online tutoring platforms therefore must include functionality that encourages 
engagement and interaction, such as interactive learning exercises and activities, 
opportunities for group work, and mechanisms for question answer between the 
lectures, as well as breaks to avoid fatigue. Combining both approaches is the best way 
to strengthen the learning and social life. 
2.7 Related Work and Existing Platforms 
There are a number of established platforms that offer reference for the development of 
Learnity. Preply, a popular online tutoring marketplace, allows students to be matched 
with tutors for a variety of subjects and languages, using advanced matching 
algorithms, video conferencing tools, and scheduling systems. 
Other platforms are international and their target audience are mostly Cambridge 
students but our Learnity platform enables student from all boards in Pakistan to select 
courses according to their particular board curriculum right now we are only focusing on 
Sindh province. 
2.8 Summary 
The summary is that online tutoring systems are a major and ever-growing area in 
educational technology.The concept of peer-to-peer learning, along with advancements 
in web technology and artificial intelligence, provides flexible, affordable and curriculum 
dependent education. Learnity is developed to make learning easy by connecting 
students and tutors online. The main objective of learnity is to provide a local web based 
platform for the students and teachers of Sindh province of Pakistan. Learnity platform 
to facilitate remote tutoring, to improve learning flexibility and to enable teacher 
monetization.
