navbar and sidebar are ourt of sync and over layed in admin accesss
/api/auth/profile is being called again and again unnecessarly 
on dashboard/student page course are constantly loading without needing it 
student portal is so slow make it faster 
All student pages muct be server side rendered 
cahceing is not being implemented fix it 
check if there are any already implemented solutions for the above problems in code base 
if not then only implement the additional code for the above problems
implement SSR PPR , ISR ,  SSG where necessary 
make the portal faster form 10s to 1s at max initial load and 100ms to 200ms load time for other pages
also chec if there are any other problems and diagnose the solution
pages included :
 /student/dashboard/page.tsx
 /student/achievements/page.tsx
 /student/courses/page.tsx
 /student/profile/page.tsx
 /student/progress/page.tsx
 /student/public-courses/page.tsx



same issue is with teachers 
all pages are taking like 10-15s per load which is a terible user experience i want you to fix it
apply SSR PPR , ISR ,  SSG where necessary 
do not break the present code base structure 
try to optimise the pages i want you to reduc it to 10 to 15x, reduce the initial load time to 1s to 1.5s at max and 100ms to 200ms for other loadinngs or returning to pages use cahcing , ssr and better optimization make a comprehensive documentation and then impleent the chanegs make each page ssr side no page.tsx or layout.tsx shoudl remain client side also do not break the code base , do not helucinate at all
