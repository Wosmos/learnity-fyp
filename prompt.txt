# Learnity Logo Brief: Onyx Modern (Learn + Unity)

## 1. Brand Philosophy (Product Manager)
**Learnity** is the intersection of pedagogy and community. 
- **Concept**: **Learn** (the spark of knowledge) + **Unity** (the collective strength of students/teachers).
- **Core Values**: Interconnection, Modernity, Social Learning.
- **Audience**: Professional educators and tech-savvy students.

## 2. Visual Strategy (Senior Designer) - Onyx Edition
We are moving away from playful/vibrant and toward a "Premium Tech" aesthetic.

### Symbology: The Interlocking Bond
- **The Mark**: Two interlocking circular links. The left link incorporates a sharp vertical line forming an abstract 'L'.
- **The Unity**: The interlocking nature represents the community aspect (Unity), while the separate yet connected loops represent individual learning paths.
- **The "Onyx" Aesthetic**: 
    - **Background**: Deep Charcoal/Matte Black (#111827).
    - **Primary Glow**: Neon Cyan (#22D3EE) representing "Logic & Learning".
    - **Secondary Accent**: Electric Indigo (#818CF8) representing "Community & Unity".
- **Texture**: Glossy gradients and subtle inner glows to mimic glassmorphism.

### Typography
- **Font**: "Inter" or similar bold Sans-Serif.
- **Letter Spacing**: Wide tracking (200ms) for a premium, spacious feel.
